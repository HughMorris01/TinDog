Website Name: TinDog

Purpose: This website is a simple clone of what the Tinder website used to look like a few years ago. It was made along with course instruction on Udemy's 2023 Complete Web Development Boot Camp. The purpose of the page was to practice boostrap grid layouts, carousels and other common elements. It's merely a mock page, so the external hyperlinks don't work.

Text Editor: VS Code
HTML5
CSS3
Boostrap 5.3.0
